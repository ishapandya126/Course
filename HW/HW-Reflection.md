# Reflection

Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?
Ans: 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
Ans: 

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Ans: 


### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?
Ans: 

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
Ans: 
3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Ans: 

### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?
Ans: The division of a general huge task into subtasks enabled us to better divide the work and follow up on it's completion. ALso yhe daily stand ups helped us keep on the same page while not wasting too much time on just planning.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
Ans: Test-first programming. It is counter-intutive to first write all the tests for required functions and then develop the actual functions. I would want to learn more about how to write efficient tests to be more comfortable with this practice.
3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Ans: 
Pair programmming helped us accelerate work initially, so I would wnat to implement that in future projects with more story points. Also, I would want to use agile as an approach to monitor and regulate the progress of the project.
### Overall

Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and constrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
